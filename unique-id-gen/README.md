# Snowflake ID Generation

The Snowflake ID is a 64-bit integer composed of several parts:

- **Timestamp (41 bits)**: The number of milliseconds since a custom epoch.
- **Datacenter ID (5 bits)**: Identifies the datacenter.
- **Worker ID (5 bits)**: Identifies the worker within the datacenter.
- **Sequence Number (12 bits)**: A counter that increments for IDs generated within the same millisecond.

## Calculation of Total Unique IDs

### Timestamp (41 bits):
- The maximum value that can be represented by 41 bits is \(2^{41} - 1\).
- This corresponds to approximately 69 years in milliseconds.

### Datacenter ID (5 bits):
- The maximum value that can be represented by 5 bits is \(2^5 - 1 = 31\).
- This allows for 32 unique datacenter IDs.

### Worker ID (5 bits):
- The maximum value that can be represented by 5 bits is \(2^5 - 1 = 31\).
- This allows for 32 unique worker IDs per datacenter.

### Sequence Number (12 bits):
- The maximum value that can be represented by 12 bits is \(2^{12} - 1 = 4095\).
- This allows for 4096 unique IDs per millisecond per worker.

## Total Unique IDs Calculation
To calculate the total number of unique IDs that can be generated, we multiply the number of unique values for each component:

- **Total unique timestamps**: \(2^{41}\)
- **Total unique datacenter IDs**: \(2^5 = 32\)
- **Total unique worker IDs**: \(2^5 = 32\)
- **Total unique sequence numbers per millisecond**: \(2^{12} = 4096\)

The total number of unique IDs is:

\[ \text{Total Unique IDs} = 2^{41} \times 32 \times 32 \times 4096 \]

Let's calculate this step-by-step:

- \(2^{41} = 2,199,023,255,552\)
- \(32 \times 32 = 1,024\)
- \(1,024 \times 4096 = 4,194,304\)

Finally:

\[ 2,199,023,255,552 \times 4,194,304 = 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 \]
